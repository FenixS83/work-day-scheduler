### Overview
Modifying existing starter code to create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day

### Explanation of task
For this project I took existing code and I incorporated Jquery, Bootstrap, and MomentJS to make a functioning Work Day Scheduler.  This scheduler incorporates local storage so that tasks can be saved and referred back to at a later time.  

### Benefit of Work Day Scheduler
Schedules help keep even the busiest person on time.  It encourages organization and productivity. This scheduler has the current date and time reflected in the header.  The section of the scheduler that has the rows of hours will highlight different colors depending on if they are past, present or future compared to current time. The storage feature will ensure that important information wont be lost if the browser is closed or reloaded.

### Personal Benefit of Work Day Scheduler
This project allowed me to spend a little time getting more familiar with Jquery, Bootstrap and Moment.JS.  I have gained useful knowledge that I hope to be able to use for bigger and better projects in the future. 

### Screenshots of Work Day Scheduler
![The Work Day Scheduler contains a hero banner in the header that contains the title and the current date and time.  The body section contains rows and columns. Each row has an hour assingment, a text input field and a save button.  All information enter and saved will be stored in local storage until such time that it is cleared.] (./assets/images/Screen Shot 2021-09-30 at 9.43.14 PM.png)
